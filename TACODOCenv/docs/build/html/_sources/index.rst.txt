TACOCAT is an open source program that performs thermal hydraulic core calculations using the single heated channel method. The intent of TACOCAT is to be a core analysis tool to aid in reactor development as well as academia and research. TACOCAT's modular design allows users to use different reactor geometries, fuels, and coolant types for reactor core analysis.
