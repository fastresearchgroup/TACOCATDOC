The Nusselt number is a dimensionless number, named after a German engineer Wilhelm Nusselt. 
the Nusselt number represents the enhancement of heat transfer through a fluid layer as a result of convection.

The Nusselt Number is a dimensionalless number that represents the temperature gradient and the heat transfer convection at the surface of the fluid. 
TACOCAT will calculate the Nusselt Number by using the information that is provided is needed.
The user will specify which geometry they will be working with. TACOCAT uses two different Nusselt Number correlations.
The first is the Dittus-Boelter Equation. This correlation is used when the fluid expereiences a large tempurature difference across it during a fully developed turbulent flow in small circular tubes.
It should be used when calculating the Nusselt Number for smooth tubes.
